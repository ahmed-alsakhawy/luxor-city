    <h4>first of all:<br><span>Tomb of the valleynof kings</span></h4>

    <figure><img src="images/The tomb of the valley of kings outside.jpeg"></figure>

    <p>The Theban Hills are dominated by the peak of al-Qurn, known to the Ancient Egyptians as ta dehent, or "The Peak" It has a pyramid-shaped appearance, and it is probable that this echoed the pyramids of the Old Kingdom, more than a thousand years prior to the first royal burials carved here. Its isolated position also resulted in reduced access, and special tomb police (the Medjay) were able to guard the necropolis.<br>

        While the iconic pyramid complex of the Giza Plateau have come to symbolize ancient Egypt, the majority of tombs were cut into rock. Most pyramids and mastabas contain sections which are cut into ground level, and there are full rock-cut tombs in Egypt that date back to the Old Kingdom. </p>

    <div class="info_4">
    <h4>Karnak temple</h4>

    <figure><img src="images/karnak temple.jpeg"></figure>

    <p>The history of the Karnak Temple complex is largely the history of Thebes. The city does not appear to have been of any significance before the Eleventh Dynasty, and any temple building here would have been relatively small and unimportant, with any shrines being dedicated to the early god of Thebes, Montu. The earliest artifact found in the area of the temple is a small, eight-sided column from the Eleventh Dynasty, which mentions Amun-Re. The tomb of Intef II mentions a 'house of Amun', which implies some structure, whether a shrine or a small temple is unknown. The ancient name for Karnak, Ipet-Isut (usually translated as 'most select of places') only really refers to the central core structures of the Precinct of Amun-Re, and was in use as early as the 11th Dynasty, again implying the presence of some form of temple before the Middle Kingdom expansion.</p>

    <div class="info_5">
    <h4>Luxor Temple</h4>

    <figure><img src="images/luxor temple.jpg"></figure>

    <p>The Luxor Temple is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. In the Egyptian language it was known as ipet resyt, "the southern sanctuary". It was one of the two primary temples on the east bank, the other being Karnak. Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the pharaoh in death. Instead, Luxor temple is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship; it may have been where many of the pharaohs of Egypt were crowned in reality or conceptually (as in the case of Alexander the Great, who claimed he was crowned at Luxor but may never have traveled south of Memphis, near modern Cairo).</p>

    <div class="info_6">
    <h4>Hatshepsut temple</h4>

    <figure><img src="images/hatshepsut temple.jpeg"></figure>

    <p>The Temple of Hatshepsut is a mortuary temple built during the reign of Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt. Located opposite the city of Luxor, it is considered to be a masterpiece of ancient architecture. Its three massive terraces rise above the desert floor and into the cliffs of Deir el-Bahari. Her tomb, KV20, lies inside the same massif capped by El Qurn, a pyramid for her mortuary complex. At the edge of the desert, 1 km (0.62 mi) east, connected to the complex by a causeway lies the accompanying valley temple. Across the river Nile, the whole structure points towards the monumental Eighth Pylon, Hatshepsut's most recognizable addition to the Temple of Karnak and the site from which the procession of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley departs. The temple's twin functions are identified by its axes: on its main east-west axis, it served to receive the barque of Amun-Re at the climax of the festival, while on its north-south axis it represented the life cycle of the pharaoh from coronation to rebirth.</p>

    <div class="info_7">
    <h4>Colossi memnon</h4>

    <figure><img src="images/colossi memnon.jpeg"></figure>

    <p>The Colossi of Memnon are two massive stone statues of the Pharaoh Amenhotep III, which stand at the front of the ruined Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III, the largest temple in the Theban Necropolis. They have stood since 1350 BCE, and were well known to ancient Greeks and Romans, as well as early modern travelers and Egyptologists. The statues contain 107 Roman-era inscriptions in Greek and Latin, dated to between 20-250CE; many of these inscriptions on the northernmost statue make reference to the Greek mythological king Memnon, whom the statue was then – erroneously – thought to represent.

        Scholars have debated how the identification of the northern colossus as "Memnon" is connected to the Greek name for the entire Theban Necropolis as the Memnonium.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info_8">
    <h4>Medinet habu</h4>

    <figure><img src="images/medinet habu.jpeg"></figure>

    <P>Medinet Habu is the modern name of the area where Ramses III built his burial temple. Ramses III ruled Egypt for 31 years (approximately 1183-1153 B.C.). Medinet means “city” and Habu is actually the name of the city. Therefore it is “Habu City.” A straight axis runs through the temple, but originally there were several doors. The whole temple would have had a roof in ancient times.</P>
